# Learning about Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like the most about version control is how it allows multiple collaborators to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. 

What I find challenging is resolving merge conflicts when two people make changes to the same part of a file.
